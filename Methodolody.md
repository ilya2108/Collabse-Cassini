# ESG & CSR scoring methodology for SMEs and Enterprises

## 1. General Assessment Structure

ESG and CSR assessment is conducted on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 is the worst score and 1 is the best. The assessment is divided into the following components:

1. Environmental (E)
2. Social (S)
3. Governance (G)
4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
5. Innovation and Adaptation (I&A) - new component

## 2. Environmental Component (E)

### 2.1 Satellite Indicators

Satellites should indicate the following data starting from the date of company being placed on the reported location:
- Greenhouse gas emissions
- Air pollution
- Deforestation
- Water pollution (for relevant industries)
- Land use change
- Thermal anomalies
- Coastline changes
- Desertification

### 2.2 Environmental Management Decisions

- Investments in green technologies
- Emission reduction programs
- Biodiversity conservation initiatives
- Implementation of circular economy
- Water resource management
- Ecosystem restoration programs
- Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources
- Waste management and recycling

### 2.3 Weights of Environmental Indicators by Industry

| Industry | GHG Emissions | Air Pollution | Deforestation | Water Pollution | Land Use Change | Thermal Anomalies | Coastline Changes | Desertification |
|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Energy | 0.25 | 0.20 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| Agriculture | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.15 |
| Manufacturing | 0.20 | 0.20 | 0.10 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| IT | 0.30 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| Maritime Transport | 0.25 | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.25 | 0.10 | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.00 |
| Extractive Industries | 0.20 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.20 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 |

## 3. Social Component (S)

- Labor conditions and human rights
- Diversity and inclusion
- Engagement with local communities
- Employee health and safety
- Human capital development
- Consumer rights protection
- Supply chain management
- Social impact of products and services

## 4. Governance Component (G)

- Risk management
- Shareholder rights
- Executive compensation policy
- Cybersecurity and data protection

## 5. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

- Development of new products and services with positive social and environmental impact
- Participation in industry initiatives for sustainable development
- Collaboration with scientific institutions and startups in ESG

## 7. Score Calculation

### 7.1 Calculation of score for each component

The score for each component (E, S, G, CSR, I&A) is calculated as a weighted average of its subcomponents:

```
Component_Score = Î£ (Subcomponent_Weight * Subcomponent_Score)
```

### 7.2 Aggregated ESG score and overall score

```
ESG_Score = 0.35 * E + 0.25 * S + 0.25 * G + 0.15 * I&A
Overall_Score = 0.75 * ESG_Score + 0.25 * CSR_Score
```

## 8. Consideration of Company Specifics

- For companies related to the sea, the weight of "Water Pollution" and "Coastline Changes" indicators is increased by 0.1 each, while the weights of other indicators are proportionally decreased.
- For companies in arid regions, the weight of the "Desertification" indicator is increased by 0.1, while the weights of other indicators are proportionally decreased.
- For technology companies, the weight of the "Cybersecurity and Data Protection" indicator in the governance component is increased by 0.1.

## 9. Hybrid Platform Format

- Companies can choose the level of publicity for their data for each component separately
- Three levels of publicity are provided: fully public, partially public (aggregated data), non-public
- Public data is available for comparison based on the following parameters:
  - Company size (small, medium, large business)
  - Industry (with detailing to sub-sectors)
  - Geography (country, region, climate zone)
  - Company development stage (startup, mature company, corporation)

## 10. Impact of Company Decisions on ESG/CSR/I&A Components

- Each management decision is evaluated for its impact on various ESG, CSR, and I&A components
- The impact can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term
- An impact matrix is used to assess the effect of each decision on various components
- The synergistic effect of combining different decisions is taken into account

## 11. Frequency of Score Updates

- Satellite data is updated weekly
- Management decisions and other components are evaluated quarterly
- Overall ESG, CSR, and I&A scores are updated quarterly
- A rapid update system is provided for significant events or decisions

## 12. Data Verification

- Satellite data is verified by comparison with ground measurements and data from other sources
- Management decisions and other components are verified through audit, external expertise, and analysis of public information
- A machine learning system is used to identify anomalies and potential errors in the data
- A mechanism for companies to dispute data is provided, followed by verification

## 13. Feedback and Methodology Improvement

- Quarterly review of weights and assessment criteria
- Annual review of the overall methodology structure
- Creation of an expert council for regular review and updating of the methodology
- Feedback mechanism from companies, investors, and other stakeholders
- Integration of new scientific data and technological advances in ESG monitoring and assessment

## 14. Industry Benchmarks and Targets

- Development of industry benchmarks for each ESG, CSR, and I&A component
- Setting targets based on science-based goals (e.g., Science Based Targets initiative)
- Assessment of companies' progress relative to industry benchmarks and targets

## 15. Integration with International Standards and Initiatives

- Mapping the methodology to key international standards (GRI, SASB, TCFD)
- Consideration of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the assessment
- Integration with carbon markets and emission offset mechanisms

## 16. Scenario Analysis and Forecasting

- Development of various development scenarios for each company based on their current indicators and strategies
- Use of machine learning methods to predict future ESG and CSR indicators
- Analysis of business model resilience to various climate and social scenarios

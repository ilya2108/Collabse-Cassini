ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.

CSR stands for Corporate Social Responsibility. It is a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.
